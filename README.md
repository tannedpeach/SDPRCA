The main aim of the project is to automate the localization of root cause services that has caused the performance problem in a distributed system setup. The challenges of finding the root cause in a distributed system is enormous as the number of services running are high and the traces/logs generated by these services are sometimes beyond terabytes. An engineer is limited by his knowledge about the entire system in the distributed systems world as he would be focused on certain set of services. This work tries to come up with an approach to automate the root cause localization by using artificial intelligence techniques on the information in the traces generated by the services.

Running the project:

Intensity prediction:
1. Place the data in /data/intensity/ip/ under the root
2. Run using the command py intensity.py
3. This generates the intensity result in /data/intensity/op/

Anomaly detection:
1. Place the data in /data/detection/ip/ under the root
2. Code automatically picks the historical data from the previous result at /data/intensity/op/
3. Run following files in the sequence: py data_processing.py, py run_selecting_features.py, py run_anomaly_detection_invo_2.py, py localization_mining.py
